Dispensing microlitre amounts of liquid is the fundamental action of the life science field. The tool for this work is the micropipette. 

Micropipettes are so ubiquitous in the wet lab that you've probably seen them in movies and TV!


By leveraging advances in electronics fabrication, we have invented a low cost digital sensor that measures microlitres of liquid with high precision.

Using our sensor we can build a fundamentally different kind of micropipette.

This first-of-its-kind device will beat the current best-in-class ones in precision and cost.
