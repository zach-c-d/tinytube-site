By leveraging advances in electronics fabrication, we have invented a low cost digital sensor that measures microlitres of liquid with high precision.

Using our sensor we can build a fundamentally different kind of micropipette.

This first-of-its-kind device will beat the current best-in-class ones in precision and cost.
